We construct the Lafforgue variety, an affine variety parametrizing the simple modules of a non-commutative algebra $R$ for which the center $Z(R)$ is finitely generated and $R$ is finite as a $Z(R)$-module. Using our construction in the case of Hecke algebras, we provide a characterization for irreducibility of induced representations via the vanishing of a generalized discriminant. We explicitly compute this discriminant in the case of an Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We construct well-behaved maps from the Lafforgue variety to Solleveld's extended quotient and in the case $R$ is a complex finite type algebra to the primitive ideal spectrum.
