In 1988, Mirkovic and Vilonen and independently Ginzburg proved that, in characteristic $0$, a $G$-equivariant irreducible perverse sheaf is a character sheaf if and only if it has nilpotent singular support. In this paper, we prove that character sheaves have nilpotent singular support in any characteristic.
