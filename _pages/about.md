I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Université Clermont Auvergne](https://www.uca.fr/). I completed my PhD at Summer 2023 at the [University of Chicago](https://mathematics.uchicago.edu/) under the supervision of professor [Ngô Bảo Châu](https://math.uchicago.edu/~ngo/). I am originally from Greece and I received a B.Sc degree from the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.math.uoa.gr/). 

I work in Representation Theory and Algebraic Geometry. These days, I mainly think about Hecke algebras, $p$-adic representations, character sheaves and the Springer correspondence. 

Feel free to contact me for any questions and/or discussion!
