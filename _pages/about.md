I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Université Clermont Auvergne](https://www.uca.fr/) working with professor [Simon Riche](https://riche.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). I completed my PhD at Summer 2023 at the [University of Chicago](https://mathematics.uchicago.edu/) under the supervision of professor [Ngô Bảo Châu](https://math.uchicago.edu/~ngo/). I am originally from Greece and have received my B.Sc degree from the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.math.uoa.gr/), where I will also be based in the following academic year.

I work in Representation Theory and Algebraic Geometry. These days, I mainly think about Hecke algebras and Springer theory. 

Feel free to contact me for any questions and/or discussion!
